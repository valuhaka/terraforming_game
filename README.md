## How to play

In this game, you must terraform a planet and seed it with microscopic life. In practice, this can be achieved buy using items bought from the in-game store.

You spawn on the space station but can descend to the planet's surface. This allows you to observe the procedurally generated biomes. However, that is not necessary to complete the game. 

To complete the game, you have to get the parametres to match the Earth's equivalents. Mean temperature should be around 294 kelvin, O2 concentration at around 0.2 and so on.
